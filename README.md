# Overview

A simple iPhone app controlling a Wasatch Photonics SiG-785 Raman spectrometer.

# Building

# Dependencies

- XCode 10.1 (Swift 4.2.1)
- [jazzy](https://github.com/realm/jazzy) (render docs)

## CocoaPods

On MacOS, install CocoaPod package manager using HomeBrew:

    $ brew install cocoapods

To install pods used by SiGDemo, use:

    $ git clone git@github.com:WasatchPhotonics/Wasatch.Swift.git
    $ cd Wasatch.Swift
    $ pod install

The current version of SwiftCharts seems to have a single line that needed 
changed...something about a bevel.  Xcode knew how to fix it, but I had to
use "Manage Schemes" to expose the SwiftCharts scheme for editing in Xcode,
then a âŒ˜-B to build the framework and find the problematic line.

(Note that Jazzy installation seems to prefer _gem_ over _brew_...YMMV.)

## Charting

- [SwiftChart](https://github.com/gpbl/SwiftChart)

XCode note: make following patch in Chart.swift:

    < lineLayer.lineJoin = kCALineJoinBevel
    > lineLayer.lineJoin = CAShapeLayerLineJoin.bevel

# References

I'm new to Xcode and Swift, so leaving some breadcrumbs.  These 
were all useful in learning enough Swift to stand-up the demo:

# Testing

These iPhone apps were also used as 3rd-party confirmation that BLE services were
discoverable, and that characteristics could be read and written:

- [BLE Scanner](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ble-scanner-4-0/id1221763603?mt=8)

If you have `jazzy` installed, just type this:

    $ make docs

# Backlog

## Version 1.0

- support in-app dark correction
- add "desc" note field
- add fields to specify URL for cloud upload

  as soon as the first spectrum packet is received

## Version 2.0

- support compound matching / identification
- make BLE screen more like Settings
    - two sections, "Connected" and "Available"
    - add little blue checkmark by connected device
